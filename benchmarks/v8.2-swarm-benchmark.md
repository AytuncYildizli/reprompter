## Template Contract Snapshot

| Profile | Template | Approx Tokens | Contract Coverage | Proxy Quality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| marketing-swarm | `references/marketing-swarm-template.md` | 898 | 100% | 10/10 |
| engineering-swarm | `references/engineering-swarm-template.md` | 964 | 100% | 10/10 |
| ops-swarm | `references/ops-swarm-template.md` | 959 | 100% | 10/10 |

## Notes

- This benchmark validates deterministic routing and template contract completeness.
- Runtime latency/cost depends on selected model and execution surface (Claude/Codex/OpenClaw).
- Use this as a repeatable pre-release smoke benchmark before public launches.
